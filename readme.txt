Adds an Idea Management System to your WordPress!

== Description ==

WP Idea Stream adds a light Idea Management System to your WordPress Blog. Your members will be able to submit ideas from the front end.
A star rating system and 4 widgets to display Ideas related content are included.

In IdeaStream admin menu, you'll be able to customize the behavior of the plugin thanks to the submenu IdeaStream Options.

Once the plugin is installed, simply add at least one category of the Idea Post Type from the back end in order to activate the submit form.
You can specify the IdeaStream list of ideas to show directly on your blog home from the reading options.

Since version 1.2, **this plugin requires WordPress 3.9** and is optimized for twentytwelve theme.

If you're using another theme, i advise you to copy the templates of WP Idea Stream templates dir and then paste them into your theme's folder.
Then you can edit the copy you put in your theme's folder to suit your design. If an IdeaStream template is found in active theme dir, it overrides the one in the plugin dir.

WP Idea Stream is available in French and English.

Here's a very long demo of it (sorry for my english) :

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm not using WordPress 3.9, is this plugin compatible with an older version ? =
Version 1.2 of the plugin requires WordPress 3.9, if you want to use this plugin with an earlier version of WordPress, you'll need to download a previous version of the plugin.
I advise you to browse the [different versions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-idea-stream/developers/ "Other version") available and choose version 1.0.3 if you run a WordPress from 3.1 to 3.4.2 and 1.1 if you run a WordPress from 3.5.

= I'm still using the twentyeleven or twentyten theme with WordPress 3.5, how can i make the different templates go along with it ? =
You can download from my dorpbox a [zip file](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2322874/templates-2010-11.zip "my dropbox") containing the idea templates optimized for this 2 themes. Once you've downloaded them, simply copy and paste them
in your twentyeleven or twentyten (child) theme directory.

= When on front end, idea category or tag are displaying a 404 ? =

To fix this, you can go to your permalinks settings and simply click on the "save changes" button to update your permalinks settings

= If you have any other questions =
